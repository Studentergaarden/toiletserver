** About

The server is written in [[http://www.lua.org][lua]] using the [[https://github.com/esmil/lem][Lua Event Machine]], along with the [[https://github.com/esmil/lem-streams][stream]]
and [[https://github.com/esmil/lem-postgres][PostgreSQL]] libraries for it.


** API

The servers response to an AJAX call can easily be checked by using =jason-xs= - which format it nicely - in the following way:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt-get libjson-xs-perl
curl -s http://server-addr. | json-xs | less
#+END_SRC
